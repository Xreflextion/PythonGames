## Guess the Number
### Instructions
You try to guess a number that the computer has generated. First, choose a difficulty. Easy will be a number between 1-9, medium will be a number between 1-50, and hard will be a number between 1-100. When you guess a number, the computer will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. The computer will track your lowest number of guesses for each difficulty.

## Rock Paper Scissors
### Instructions
The computer has chosen either rock, paper, or scissors. You type rock, paper, or scissors and either win, lose, or tie with the computer. The computer will keep track of the score for each session. (You can also type r, p, s in place of the words)

## Cows and Bulls
### Instructions
You try to guess a four digit number that the computer has created. If you guessed a digit in the right placeholder, the computer will print bull (Ex: the number is 1234, you guessed 1677. Computer will print 1 bull). If you guessed a digit correctly but in the wrong placeholder, the computer will print cow (Ex: the number is 1234. you guessed 3467. Computer will print 2 cows (for 3 and 4)). 
If you choose easy mode, the number will have no repeated digits. 
If you choose hard mode, the number might have two of the same digit. If there is a repeated number in the answer and you guess the number once, there will only be one cow (or bull) (Ex. Answer is 7111, you guess 1246. There will only be one cow).  You only have 10 attempts to guess the number before you lose.
